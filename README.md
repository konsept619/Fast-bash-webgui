# Fast-webgui
Open webgui of your router etc.

This short bash script is designed to fasten the process of opening webgui of your router, access point etc.
It's useful when your IP adress is changing and you don't remember it or don't want to type it number by number. 

It just takes your IP address assigned to your network interface and opens webpage with same address. Simple but sometimes usefull. 

This is part of my bash learning adventure and I'm aware of its simplicity.
